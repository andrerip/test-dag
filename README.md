## Description

This is a demo project for showing how to simple use a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). 

Use of the library [graphlib](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib) for that purpose.

A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a structure composed of interconnected nodes where each connection points from one node to another without forming any loops.

## Installation
